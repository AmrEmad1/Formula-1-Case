## 🛠️ Libraries Used

| Library | Version | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `pandas` | ≥ 1.5 | Data loading, cleaning, transformation |
| `matplotlib` | ≥ 3.5 | Base charting engine |
| `seaborn` | ≥ 0.12 | Styled, higher-level charts |

No machine learning, no complex SQL, no advanced Python patterns.
The code is intentionally written to be **readable by beginners**.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Decisions

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| `time` missing in 67% of results rows | Expected — only the race winner has an absolute time; others show a gap like `+1.5s` |
| Drop rows with missing `dob` for Q1 | Can't calculate driver age without a birthdate |
| Q2/Q3 qualifying times mostly null pre-2006 | Modern qualifying format only introduced in 2006 |
| Exclude `+X Lap` statuses from DNF analysis | Lapped drivers did finish the race — they just completed fewer laps |
| Group by `season + race_name` for Q7 | Same race name runs every year; season is needed to identify each unique event |
